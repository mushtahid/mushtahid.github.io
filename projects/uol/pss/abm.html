			<h2>
			What is Agent-Based Model?
			</h2>		
			<p>
			Traditionally, we have been collecting individal level
			date to generate summary statistic and carry out inferential analysis. This is undoubtedly of 
			immense importance as it allows us to predict not only population but also
			individual level behaviour (provided raw data has been collected at an individual
			level). However, the inidividual level measures we obtain are based on the 
			summary statistic and may not* represent how a particular individual may act.			
			It might be helpful to think of this as a low-resolution image
			where you can get a sense of the overall picture but not really the fine details.
			</p>
			<p>
			Agent-Based Models (ABM) on the other hand, allows us to keep track of an individual as 
			as an individual! Thus, it allows us to analyse the risks/behaviours of an individal
			more accurately and thus generate a better individual and population level model. You
			can think of this as a high-resolution image where you can see the finer details!
			You can <a title="Learn more about ABM" target="_blank" href="https://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/courses/computing/practicals/python/agent-framework/part1/index.html">
			learn more about ABM from the course page <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a>.
			</p>
			<p>
			* <i>I am not in any way suggesting that individual level measures such as relative risk/odds ratio
			obtained from traditional research methods are not "good enough"! Such methods have a proven track record 
			and in any case do not need any approval from me!</i>
